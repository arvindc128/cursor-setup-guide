# ðŸ“Œ Project Milestones

## Phase 1: Manual Operations & Testing
- [ ] Basic API integration
- [ ] Database schema setup
- [ ] Basic OpenAI integration
- [ ] Manual data collection script
- [ ] Manual analysis trigger
- [ ] Manual review interface
- [ ] Testing and refinement

---

## Phase 2: Worker Refactoring
- [ ] Split call-worker (API + data collection)
- [ ] Split analysis-worker (OpenAI + processing)
- [ ] Split api-worker (dashboard & admin endpoints)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Add usage and cost tracking

## Learnings & Architecture Decisions

### âœ… Worker Architecture
**Current Setup**
- Single worker handling both API and OpenAI calls

**Issues**
- Harder to scale
- No isolation for error handling or rate limits
- Complex debugging

**Decision**
- Split workers:
  - `call-worker`
  - `analysis-worker`
  - `api-worker`

**Benefits**
- Modular scaling
- Easier error tracking
- Cost separation
