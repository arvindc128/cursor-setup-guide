Cursor AI Usage Guide: Practical Examples


This document provides concrete examples of how to effectively use Cursor AI in your daily development workflow. Bookmark this guide for quick reference when you need inspiration for prompts or techniques.

1. Code Generation Examples
Writing New Functions
Prompt:
Write a function that fetches data from an API with error handling and timeouts
Better Prompt:
Create an async JavaScript function named 'fetchDataSafely' that:
- Takes parameters for URL, timeout (default 5000ms), and retries (default 3)
- Uses fetch API with AbortController for timeout handling
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Has proper error handling and type checking
- Returns { data, error } object
Tip: The detailed prompt gives the AI specific requirements that match your team's coding standards.
Creating Components
Prompt:
Create a React component for a form
Better Prompt:
Create a React functional component called UserProfileForm that:
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect)

## Best Practices for Using These Examples

1. **Adapt to Your Context**: Modify these examples to include details specific to your project, technologies, and team standards.

2. **Build on Results**: Use the AI's output as a starting point, then refine with your domain knowledge.

3. **Maintain a Prompt Library**: Save successful prompts that produce good results for your specific codebase.

4. **Combine Approaches**: Chain multiple prompt types together for complex tasks (e.g., analyze, then refactor, then document).

5. **Share Successes**: When you find a particularly effective prompt pattern, share it with your team.

Remember that Cursor AI is a tool to augment your development process, not replace critical thinking. Always review and understand generated code before implementing it.Made with Artifacts are user-generated and may contain unverified or potentially unsafe content.
